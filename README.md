# Image Classification

In this notebook, we will be analyzing cats and dogs images using a Transfer Learning model. We will use 2000 images for training and 1000 images for tests. An ImageDataGenerator is used to generate images. Without it, the model was overfitting the training data. This model show much more accuracy than the CNN model.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install -r requiremets.txt
```

We get more than 99% accuracy in predicting train and validation images.
